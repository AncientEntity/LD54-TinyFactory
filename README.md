# LudumDare54

You’re the manager of a tiny factory getting orders to expand! Every 15 seconds a new input and output will appear and you have to connect them by building conveyor belts! The goal is to see how long you can last until you run out of space to build more. You’re 2 most important tools will be the conveyor belt, and the underground belt.

No game engine used! Just raw python and pygame for visuals. Usually use Unity but due to the recent news decided to use this as a good opportunity to make my own engine of sorts!

Fairly simple, just download the code and run main.py (assuming you have python 3.X and pygame installed) I have a windows compiled version on the [Ludum Dare page](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/tiny-factory) if that's more your thing!
